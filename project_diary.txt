372 Project Diary

2/8/19 (in-class)
- decided the most important feature â€”> 2 player or AI
- came up with desirable features and ranked the top three features
- worked on user-stories and came up with things a player should be able to do
- came up with seven different user-stories
- ranked the user-stories in order of importance
- discussed how much time each user story will take to accomplish and its difficulty level
- discussed the expected time and difficulty level for the user-stories
- created a discord channel for the project

2/9/19
- setup a simple CMake project for SFML

2/10/19 
- created and debugged a board class

- Nami: Pair programming with CJ for two hours, we had lots of fun. I needed a lot of help and it was nice to have someone to work with CJ and get help from him. I think we were on task and tried to make clean node and use version control. This was my first experience using just the text editor and command line to program, so it was pretty rough at first. But I think I kind of got the idea now.

- CJ: I pair programmed with Nami for 2 hours. We accomplished roughly half of a 4 DP project (Allow a player to initiate a game). Specifically, we created a simple interface for board class and then tested it in main.cpp. We specifically tested that we could place ships and hit or miss ships. It appears that we accomplished 1 hour of work for every difficulty point. We probably could have done some test driven development but we mostly focused on making code which compiled.  I might devote some later effort into making some test cases for the functions in the board class or for the entire class. However, I feel the code we made (whose primary goal was to compile) was successful.
Pair programming was a new experience for me. It felt a lot like tutoring,  Nami and I have inconsistent coding style (for example, comments are common in her code but not so much in mine).  This inconsistency led me to constantly critique and advise (perhaps annoyingly) on all sorts of things. Despite this, I felt like we were on task the entire time.  I think it would be useful to have a standard for code. That said, I don't care enough and I feel it would take too long to develop and adhere to. While coding was slower than if I had done it by myself, I was able to spend more time thinking about the end goal.
I look forward to working with Nami again.
